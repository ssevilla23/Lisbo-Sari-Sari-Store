# ðŸ›’ Lisbo Sari-Sari Store
The Lisbo Sari-Sari Store is a static website I created
to promote my familyâ€™s convenience store in the Philippines.
This project serves as both an online presence to showcase the
storeâ€™s offerings and as an opportunity to further develop and
refine my web development skills.

It includes a few key features such as:

+ Photos of the products and the store appearance.
+ Information about the storeâ€™s history and their key services.
+ A translation feature that allows the website to be viewed in both English and Tagalog.
